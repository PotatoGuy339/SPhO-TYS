\begin{problem}
    In 1899, Max Planck introduced the units $\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}$, $c$ and $G$, where $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo and $G$ is the Newton gravitational constant so that the force between two bodies of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ placed a distance $r$ apart is given by \[F=G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r_2}\]

    \begin{subproblem}
        In terms of these Planck units, write down the dimensions of mass, length and time. These quantities are called the Planck mass $M_{pl}$, the Planck length $l_{pl}$ and the Planck time $t_{pl}$. \hfill $[9]$
    \end{subproblem}

    \begin{subproblem}
        Find the value of $M_{pl}$ in SI (i.e. metres-kilogramme-seconds, mks) units.   \hfill $[2]$
    \end{subproblem}

    \begin{subproblem}
        Find the ratio \[\frac{E_{grav}}{m_e c^2}\] where $E_{grav}$ is the gravitational energy between two electrons separated by a distance equal to the Compton wavelength of an electron of mass $m_e$.    \hfill $[4]$
    \end{subproblem}

    \begin{subproblem}
        Consider a particle of mass $M_{pl}$. Find the ratio \[\frac{E_{grav}}{M_{pl} c^2}\] where $E_{grav}$  is the gravitational energy between two such particles separated by a distance equal to their own Compton wavelength. Thus, $M_{pl}$ can be interpreted as the mass scale that quantum gravitational effects become important. 

        
        [Note: The energy of a photon with the Compton wavelength of a particle is the same as the rest mass of the particle.]

\begin{solution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        \begin{align}
	[\hbar] &= \text{kg m}^2 \text{s}^{-1} \\
	[c] &= \text{m s}^{-1}\\
	[G] &= \text{m}^3 \text{s}^{-2} \text{kg}^{-1}
        \end{align}
        To find $M_{pl}$, let it be $M_{pl}=\hbar^\alpha c^\beta G^\gamma$
        \begin{align}
	   [M_{pl}] &= \text{kg}^{\alpha-\gamma} \text{m}^{2\alpha+\beta+3\gamma} \text{s}^{-\alpha-\beta-2\gamma} \\
	    \alpha-\gamma &= 1\\
	   2\alpha+\beta+3\gamma &= 0\\
	   -\alpha-\beta-2\gamma &=0
        \end{align}
        Solving, 
\[\alpha=\frac{1}{2}, \beta=\frac{1}{2}, \gamma=-\frac{1}{2}\]
        Hence, $M_{pl} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}$\\
        Repeating the procedure for $l_{pl}$ and $t_{pl}$, we find
\[l_pl = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}, \quad t_{pl} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
    
    \begin{subsolution}
        Direct substitution of constants into $M_{pl} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}}$ gives us $M_{pl} = 2.18 \times 10^{-8} \text{ kg}$.
    \end{subsolution}
    
    \begin{subsolution}
        The Compton wavelength is given by $\lambda_{comp} = \frac{h}{mc}$. So
        \begin{align} 
	|E_{grav}| &= \frac{G m_e^2}{\left(\frac{h}{m_e c}\right) } = \frac{Gm_e^3 c}{h} \\
	\left|  \frac{E_{grav}}{m_e c^2} \right| &= \frac{Gm_e^2}{ch} = 2.79 \times 10^{-46}
\end{align}
    \end{subsolution}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    A block of mass $M$ rests on a fixed plane inclined at angle $\theta$. A horizontal force of $Mg$ is applied to the block, as shown in Fig. \ref{2010q2}. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane is $\mu$.

        \caption{Horizontal force on a block.} \label{2010q2}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{subproblem}
        Assuming that the friction force between the block and the plane is large enough to keep the block at rest, determine the magnitude of the normal and friction forces (call them $N$ and $F_y$ ) that the plane exerts on the block in terms of $M$ and $\mu$, and
    \end{subproblem}

    \begin{subproblem}
        Determine the range of angles $\theta$ for which the block remain at rest on the plane in terms of $\mu$.  
    \hfill{[11]}\end{subproblem}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{spho_book_TYS_images/2010q2_2.png}
    \begin{subsolution}
        I don't think it's possible to express $N, F_f$ purely in terms of $M,\mu$. It will depend on angle $\theta$ as well.
        Balancing forces parallel to the slope, \[M_{g} \cos \theta+{I}_{f}-m g \sin \theta=0\]
        Balancing forces perpendicular to the slope, \[N=M g(\sin \theta+\cos \theta)\]
        Lastly, the frictional force satisfies the inequality \[\left|F_{f}\right| \leq \mu N\]
        Now we just need to solve this to get \[F_{g}=-M_{g}(\sin \theta-\cos \theta)\] and \[N=M_{g}(\sin \theta+\cos \theta)\]
    \end{subsolution}

A mobile is formed by supporting four metal butterflies of equal mass $m$ from a string of length $L$. The points of support are evenly spaced a distance $\ell$ apart as shown in Figure \ref{2010q3}.

    Show that the distance $D$ between the end points of the string is
    \[D=\frac{L}{5}\left(a \cos \theta_{1}+b \cos \left[\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2} \tan \theta_{1}\right)\right]+1\right)\]

\begin{problem}
    A $\qty{670}{\kg}$ meteorite is composed of aluminium. At a distance far from the Earth, its temperature is $\qty{-15}{\degreeCelsius}$ and it moves with a speed of $\qty{14.0}{\km\per\s}$ relative to the Earth. As it crashes into the planet, the resulting additional internal energy is shared equally between the meteor and the planet. Assuming that all of the material of the meteor rises momentarily to the same final temperature, determine this temperature. You may also assume that the specific heat of liquid and of gaseous aluminium is $\qty{1170}{\J\per\kg\per\K}$, the latent heat of fusion and vaporisation of aluminium are $\qty{3.97e5}{\J\per\kg}$ and $\qty{1.14e7}{\J\per\kg}$ respectvely, and the melting point and boiling point of aluminium are $\qty{660}{\K}$ and $\qty{2450}{\K}$ respectively.

    A pion at rest with a mass $m_{\pi}$ decays to a muon of mass $m_{\mu}$ and an antineutrino of negligible mass. The reaction is written as $\pi^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{-}+\bar{\nu}$. Calculate the kinetic energy of the muon and the energy of the antineutrino in electron volts. You may take $m_{\pi}=273 m_{e}$ and $m_{\mu}=207 m_{e}$ where $m_{e}$ is the rest mass of the electron.

    A smaller disk of radius $r$ and mass $m$ is attached rigidly to the face of a second larger disk of radius $R$ and mass $M$ as shown in Figure \ref{2010q6}. The center of the small disk is located at the edge of the large disk. The large disk is mounted at its center on a frictionless axle. The assembly is rotated through a small angle $\theta$ from its equilibrium position and released.

    An electric motor turns a flywheel through a drive belt that joins a pulley on the motor and a pulley that is rigidly attached to the flywheel, as shown in Figure \ref{2010q7}. The flywheel is a solid disk with a mass of $\qty{80.0}{\kg}$ and a diameter of $\qty{1.25}{\m}$. It turns on a frictionless axle. Its pulley has a much smaller mass and a radius of $\qty{0.230}{\m}$. If the tension in the upper (taut) segment of the belt is $\qty{135}{\N}$ and the flywheel has a clockwise angular acceleration of $\qty{1.67}{\radian\per\s\squared}$, find the tension in the lower (slack) segment of the belt. \hfill{[4]}

        A toroid has a major radius $R$ and a minor radius $r$ and it is tightly wound with $N$ turns of wire, as shown in Figure \ref{2010q9}. If $R>>r$, the magnetic field in the region enclosed by the wire of the torus, of cross-sectional area $A=\pi r^{2}$, is essentially the same as the magnetic field of a solenoid that has been bent into a large circle of radius $R$.\\
