    A parallel-plate capacitor is shown in the diagram with plate area of $A = \qty{10.5}{\cm}^2$ and plate separation $2d = \qty{7.12}{mm}$.

        Letting $C_1,C_2$ and $C_3$ be the capacitances of the three capacitors with dielectric constants $\kappa_1$,$\kappa_2$ and $\kappa_3$ respectively,
        \[\text{Total capacitance } C_{eff} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{C_1}+\frac{1}{C_2+C_3}}\]
        Using $C=\frac{\kappa\epsilon_0A}{d}$ where $A$ is the area of the parallel plates of the capacitor and $d$ is the perpendicular distance between the parallel plates, 
        \[C_1=\frac{\kappa_1\epsilon_0(A/2)}{d}, C_2=\frac{\kappa_2\epsilon_0(A/2)}{d/2} \text{, and } C_3=\frac{\kappa_3\epsilon_0(A/2)}{d/2}\]
        Sub in and simplify: 
        \[C_{eff} = \boxed{\frac{A \kappa _1 \left(\kappa _2+\kappa _3\right) \epsilon _0}{d\left(\kappa _1+2 \left(\kappa _2+\kappa _3\right)\right)}}\]

    \begin{subsolution}
        \[\phi_A = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \left(\frac{q_1}{\qty{0.15}{m}}\frac{q_2}{\qty{0.05}{m}}\right) = \boxed{\qty{59900}{\V}}\text{ (3 s.f.)}\]

    \begin{subsolution}
        If I do positive work on the system, conservation of energy dictates that the electric potential energy increases (assuming all charges are at rest at the end).
    \end{subsolution}

    In both cases, the work required is the same since the electric field is conservative.

\begin{problem}
    The conducting rod shown in the figure has length $L$ and is being pulled along horizontal, frictionless conducting rails at a constant velocity $\vec{v}$. The rails are connected at one end with a metal strip. A uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$, directed out of the page, fills the region in which the rod moves. Assume that $L = \qty{10}{\cm}$, $v = \qty{5.0}{\m\per\s}$, and $B = \qty{1.2}{\tesla}$.

        \[\text{Heat generated} = P = I^2R = \boxed{\qty{0.90}{W}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        To maintain $\Vec{v}$, we need the body to be in equilibrium. Hence
        \[F_{ext} = F_{B} = BIL = \boxed{\qty{0.180}{N}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        \begin{align}
            P &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} (F_B x) \\
            &=  F_B \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
            &= F_B v \\
            &= \boxed{\qty{0.90}{W}}
        \end{align}
        It is the same as the heat generated in the rod, which provides some guarantee of your answer. 
    \end{subsolution}

\begin{problem}
    In the figure shown, after the switch S is closed at time $t = 0$, the emf of the source is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant current $I$ through S.

    \begin{subproblemalph}
        \item Find the current through the inductor as
a function of time. \hfill $[4]$
        \item At what time is the current through the
resistor equal to the current through the
inductor? \hfill $[1]$
    \end{subproblemalph} 
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    There is constant current $I$ at S. Thus, current at resistor $I_R = I - I_L$, where $I_L$ is the current at the inductor.
    The inductor's PD equation is: 
    \[V_L = L \frac{\D I_L}{\D t}\]
    The resistor's PD equation is:
    \[V_R = R I_R\]
    Using voltage loop, 
    \begin{align}
    L \frac{\D I_L}{\D t} &= R I_R \\
    \frac{\D I_L}{\D t} &= \frac{\D I - I_R}{\D t} = -\frac{\D I_R}{\D t} \\
    -L \frac{\D I_R}{\D t} &= R I_R \\
    \int \frac{1}{I_R} \D I_R &= -\int \frac{R}{L} \D t \\
    \ln{\frac{I_R}{C}} &= -RLt
    \end{align}
    When $t=0$, $I_R = 0$, since all the current just flows through the L branch. 
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    In the figure shown, a string, tied to a sinusoidal oscillator at P and running over a support at Q, is stretched by a block of mass m. The separation L between P and Q is $\qty{1.20}{\m}$, and the frequency f of the oscillator is fixed at $\qty{120}{\Hz}$. The amplitude of the motion at P is small enough for that point to be considered a node. A node also exists at Q. A standing wave appears when the mass of the hanging block is $\qty{286.1}{\g}$ or $\qty{447.0}{\g}$, but not for any intermediate mass. What is the linear density of the string? \hfill $[6]$

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{spho_book_TYS_images/2021SPhO_5.png}
    \end{figure}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    The velocity of a wave in a string is:
    \[v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{\mu}} = f\lambda\]
    Since we are provided with two values of m, \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), we check:
    \[\sqrt{\frac{m_1}{m_2}} \approx \frac{4}{5}\]
    Hence:
    \[\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2} \approx \frac{4}{5}\]
    Since the separation L must be \(\frac{n\lambda}{2}\) for some integer \(n\), we conclude that:
    \[L = 2\lambda_1 = \frac{5}{2}\lambda_2\]
    Thus:
    \[\sqrt{\frac{m_1g}{\mu}} = \frac{fL}{2}\]
    Rearranging,
    \[\sqrt{\mu} = \frac{2\sqrt{m_1g}}{fL}\]
    \[\boxed{\mu = \frac{4m_1g}{f^2L^2}}\]
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    Calculate the minimum kinetic energy an electron must have in order to be constrained within the nucleus, with a typical nuclear radius of $r = \qty{6e-15}{\m}$. Assume that the uncertainty of this electron’s position is equal to the nuclear radius r. Treat the electron relativistically. \hfill $[6]$
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    Using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the uncertainty in the electron's position $\Delta r$ must be within the nuclear radius $r$:
    \[\Delta p\Delta r \approx \Delta pr = \frac{\hbar}{2}\]
    Approximating $\Delta p$ as the electron's momentum $p$:
    \[\Delta pr \approx pr = \frac{\hbar}{2}\]
    Thus:
    \[p = \frac{\hbar}{2r}\]
    Hence the electron's kinetic energy:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            E_k &= E - m_0c^2 \\
            &= \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} - m_0c^2 \\
            &= \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2c^2}{4r^2}+m_0^2c^4} - m_0c^2} \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    A small $\qty{50}{\g}$ block slides down a frictionless surface through height $h = \qty{20}{\cm}$ and then sticks to a uniform rod of mass $\qty{100}{\g}$ and length \qty{40}{cm}. The rod pivots about point O through angle $\theta$ before momentarily stopping. Find $\theta$. \hfill $[10]$

        \centering
        \includegraphics{spho_book_TYS_images/2021SPhO_7.png}
    \end{figure}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    We first consider the collision of the block of mass $m$ and the rod of mass $M$ and length $\ell$:
    \[mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}\]
    \[p = m\sqrt{2gh}\]
    By conservation of angular momentum $L$:
    \[L = p\ell = m\ell\sqrt{2gh}\]
    We now consider the rotational kinetic energy:
    \[E = \frac{L^2}{2I}\]
    Where $I$ is the moment of inertia:
    \[I = \frac{1}{3}M\ell^2 + m\ell^2\]
    By conservation of energy,
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            E &= \frac{L^2}{2I} \\
            &= \frac{p^2\ell^2}{2(\frac{1}{3}M\ell^2 + m\ell^2)}\\
            &= \frac{2ghm^2\ell^2}{2\ell^2(\frac{1}{3}M + m)}\\
            &= \frac{ghm^2}{(\frac{1}{3}M + m)}\\
            &= mg(\ell-\ell\cos\theta)+Mg(\frac{\ell}{2}-\frac{\ell}{2}\cos\theta)\\
            &= g\ell(1-\cos\theta)(m+\frac{M}{2})
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Rearranging,
    \[1-\cos\theta = \frac{ghm^2}{g\ell(\frac{1}{3}M + m)(m+\frac{M}{2})}\]
    \[\boxed{\cos\theta = 1-\frac{hm^2}{\ell(\frac{1}{3}M + m)(m+\frac{M}{2})}}\]
\end{solution}

    The figure shows a reversible cycle through which \qty{1.00}{\mol} of a monoatomic ideal gas is taken. Volume $V_c = 8.00V_b$. Process $bc$ is an adiabatic expansion, with $p_b = 10.0\,\mathrm{atm}$ and $V_b = \qty{1.00e-3}{\cubic\m}$. 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{spho_book_TYS_images/2021SPhO_8.png}

    For the cycle, find
    \begin{subproblemalph}
        \item the energy added to the gas as heat, \hfill $[3]$
        \item the energy leaving the gas as heat, \hfill $[3]$
        \item the net work done by the gas, and \hfill $[1]$
        \item the efficiency of the cycle. \hfill $[1]$
    \end{subproblemalph}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        Firstly, we note that since the gas expands adiabatically along $bc$, letting the pressure at point $c$ be $p_c$,
        \begin{align*}
            p_c V_c^{\gamma}&=p_b V_b^{\gamma}\\
            p_c&=p_b \left(\frac{V_b}{V_c}\right)^{\gamma}
        \end{align*}
        where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index. For a monoatomic ideal gas, $\gamma=\frac{5}{3}$, so:
        \begin{align*}
            p_c&=p_b \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{5/3}\\
            &=\frac{1}{32}p_b
        \end{align*}
        Heat is added to the gas only during process $ab$:
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta Q&=\Delta U - \Delta W\\
            &=\frac{3}{2}p_b V_b - \frac{3}{2}p_c V_b - 0\\
            &=\frac{3}{2}p_b V_b\left(1-\frac{1}{32}\right)\\
            &=\frac{93}{64}p_b V_b\\
            &=\boxed{\qty{1.47e3}{\J}}\text{ (3 s.f.)}
        \end{align*}
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        Heat is removed from the gas only during process $ca$:
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta Q&=\Delta U - \Delta W\\
            &=\left(\frac{3}{2}p_cV_b-\frac{3}{2}p_cV_c\right) - \left(-p_c(V_b-V_c)\right)\\
            &=\frac{3}{2}\left(\left(\frac{1}{32}p_b\right)V_b-\left(\frac{1}{32}p_b\right)(8V_b)\right) + \left(\frac{1}{32}p_b\right)(V_b-8V_b)\\
            &=-\frac{35}{64}p_bV_b\\
            &=-\boxed{\qty{554}{\J}}\text{ (3 s.f.)}
        \end{align*}
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        After each cycle, the net heat energy input to the gas is:
        \[\frac{93}{64}p_b V_b-\frac{35}{64}p_b V_b=\frac{29}{32}p_b V_b\]
        All of this energy has to become the work done by the gas. Hence,
        \begin{align*}
            W&=\frac{29}{32}p_b V_b\\
            &=\boxed{\qty{918}{\J}}\text{ (3 s.f.)}
        \end{align*}
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        The efficiency is:
        \begin{align*}
            \eta&=\frac{W}{Q_h}\\
            &=\frac{\frac{29}{32}p_b V_b}{\frac{93}{64}p_b V_b}\\
            &=\frac{58}{93}\\
            &=\boxed{62.4\%}\text{ (3 s.f.)}
        \end{align*}

    The disc can rotate around the axis at a constant an angular frequency $\omega$. Take $t = \qty{0}{\s}$ when OA is horizontal and A is to the right and the disc is rotating anti-clockwise. Although some air resistance will help the system achieve a steady state, you may assume that air resistance is negligible in your working.
    \begin{subproblemalph}
        \item If the disc is \textbf{horizontal} and $\omega = 0$, derive an expression for the effective spring constant $k_t$ in terms of the given parameters. \hfill $[5]$
        \item If the disc is horizontal and rotating and constant angular velocity $\omega$, derive an expression for $r_0$, the equilibrium position of the mass. \hfill $[5]$
        \item If the disc is at an angle $\varphi = \qty{0.4}{\radian}$ from the horizontal, what is the lowest angular frequency $\omega$ where the point mass can just about reach the edge of the disc at a steady state? \hfill $[5]$

\begin{solution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        The mass can be modelled as being attached to two strings, with spring constants $k_1$ and $k_2$. Since the restoring force of both springs acts in the same direction (opposite displacement), the effective spring constant:
        \[k_t = k_1 + k_2 = \frac{k}{\frac{L_1}{L}} + \frac{k}{\frac{L-L_1}{L}} = \boxed{\frac{kL^2}{L_1(L-L_1)}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        Taking displacement towards A as positive, equilibrium position is initially $r_0' = L_1$ or $r_0 = L-L_1$ (I feel the question is ambiguous on the orientation of the spring). 
        When rotating at angular velocity $\omega$, forces must be balanced at $r_0 > r_0'$ as the restoring force of the spring acts towards O. Hence:
        \[k_t(r_0-r_0') = mr_0\omega^2\]
        Rearranging,
        \[r_0(k_t-m\omega^2) = k_tr_0'\]
        \[\boxed{r_0 = \frac{k_tr_0'}{k_t-m\omega^2}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
    \begin{subsolution}
        At the lowest point in the rotation, gravity works to pull the mass directly towards the edge. Hence when calculating the lowest angular velocity, we should consider the forces on the mass when it is at its lowest point along the rotation, and set $r_0 = R$. Hence:
        \[k_t(R-r_0')-mg\sin\varphi = mR\omega^2\]
        \[\boxed{\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k_t(R-r_0')-mg\sin\varphi}{mR}}}\]
    \end{subsolution}
\end{solution}
