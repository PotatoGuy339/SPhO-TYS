\begin{solution}
    Assume wavelength $\lambda$ remains constant. (reasonable as long as harmonic does not jump)
    \[f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu \lambda^2}}\]

    Label the two frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$. Since tension increases, $f_2 > f_1$. 

    For beats, 
    \[\left|f_1 - 256\right| = 5 \implies f_1 = 261, 251 \]
    \[\left|f_2 - 256\right| = 3 \implies f_2 = 259, 253 \]

    Under the restriction $f_2 > f_1$, only 2 solutions are possible, sub into our $f = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu \lambda^2}}$
    
\end{solution}
